**Training Project on my first coding job. August - October 2022.**

This project involves a website built using PERN stack. A team of 4 people, with 2 frond end developers and 2 back end developers will be working on it. I mainly worked as a frontend dev on this project to learn React.  
Breakdown of tasks done by myself on this project:  
* 1- Cursor pagination api at backend - infinite scroll feature on home and articles page consuming same cursor pagination api – loader on infinite scroll down.
* 2- Made api for displaying post detail and integration with the frontend.
* 3- Cloudinary integration on the frontend.
* 4- Signup page – integrated react hook form – end to end.
* 5- Account Detail page FE + backend api for dp upload (multer).
* 6- Designed Article Card/Article Detail components – for my articles and article detail page.
* 7- Generic reusable components – inputButton/ inputField(with react-hook-form)/ header/ postsHeader for usage on multiple pages.
* 8 -Frontend feedbacks (navbar style - different color for inactive links – text field border red on wrong input – dropzone styling using styled components etc.)
